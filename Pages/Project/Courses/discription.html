            <p id="b3">MS-CIT is an Information Technology (IT) literacy course started by MKCL in<br>
            the year 2001. It is the most popular IT Literacy course in Maharashtra. In 21st<br>
            Century, most of the new actionable knowledge is being digitally born (often <br>
            through digital collaborations), digitally stored, digitally presented, digitally<br>
            distributed, digitally accessed, digitally archived and managed. It only seems <br>
            natural that it has become an essential part of one’s personal, professional and <br>
            social life. It has also transformed the way of living in 21st Century. MS-CIT <br>
            attempts to propagate it through IT Awareness, Literacy, Functionality and<br>
            Applicability among the common people with a view to bridge the Digital Divide<br> 
            and the resultant Knowledge Divide and Development Opportunity Divide. This <br>
            surely makes a positive impact on one’s job-readiness, social behavior and <br>
            ultimately boosts the self-confidence, enabling him/her to work effectively in the<br> 
            21st Century workplace.
